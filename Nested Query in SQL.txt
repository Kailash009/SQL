Nested Query in SQL:-
---------------------------------------
>> A Query with in Query is called nested Query.
>> When we want to retreive data from table using simple query then we are unable to fetch the resultant output then we require nested Query.
-- WAQ TO GET THE FIRST HIGHEST SALARY OF AN EMPLOYEE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:-
-------------------
Select * from TN where=(select * from TN where=(select * from TN)))
Outer Query                                      Inner Query
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the per the execution process it can be divided into two parts:-
1. Non-Corelated Query.
	>> Inner Query will executed first,then outer query will execute.
	>> Outer Query result depends upon inner Query.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Co-related Query.
	>> Outer Query will executed first, then inner query will execute.
	>> Inner Query result depends upon Outer Query.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Non-Corelated Query:-
-------------------------------------------------
It can be divided into two subQuery which are as follows:	
	a) Simple/Single SubQuery.
 >> It retreive single record from the table.
-- WAQ TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION OF EMPLOYEE WHO IS GETTING THE HIGHEST SALARY.
	b) Multiple Rows SubQuery.
>> It retreive multiple record from the table.
-- WAQ TO GET ALL THE EMPLOYEE WHOSE DEPARTMENT IS SAME AS RAM AND SUBHAM.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT * FROM tbl_EMployee

select max(salary) from tbl_Employee
select * from tbl_Employee where salary=786868.00  -- Salary is Not Given
-- Non-Corelated Query  / Single Sub Query
select * from tbl_Employee where salary=(select max(salary) from tbl_Employee)   --- Inner Query
-- Outer Query     +  Inner Query 
-- Non-Corelated Query  / Multiple Row Sub Query
select * from tbl_Employee
-- WAQ TO GET ALL THE EMPLOYEE WHOSE DEPARTMENT IS SAME AS RAM AND SUBHAM.
SELECT * from tbl_Employee where ename='ram' or ename='subham'
select * from tbl_Employee where post in(select post from tbl_Employee where ename='ram' or ename='subham')
-- or
select * from tbl_Employee where post in(select post from tbl_Employee where ename in('ram','subham'))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Co-related Query.  --->>> Pending.
